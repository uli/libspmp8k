libspmp8k - Sunplus SPMP8000 SoC library & BIN Game ABI library

Fork of libspmp8k (http://code.google.com/p/libspmp8k) that provides an
extended ABI (including the emulator ABI, direct framebuffer and button
access, low-level file I/O, and CPU scaling) in a manner compatible with all
SPMP8000-based devices.
